- `functions/`: Python scripts with modular functions for:

## 📥 How to Use This Repository

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/circular-tools-benchmarking.git
cd benchmarking
```

### 2. Download input data from Zenodo:

🔗 https://zenodo.org/record/15783793

After downloading, extract the contents and organize them as follows:

- data/ → should contain all BED files with raw and filtered outputs from circRNA and eccDNA detection tools.

- repeatmasker/ → must contain the txt file required for repeat element annotation analysis.

- genomic_elements/ → must contain the GTF files and other genome annotation data required for genomic annotation analysis.

These three folders (data/, repeatmasker/ and genomic_elements/) are essential for running the pipeline.
